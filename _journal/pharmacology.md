Notes from Rang & Dale's book "Pharmacology".

## How drugs act - general principles
### Protein targets for drug binding
Four main kinds of regulatory protein are commonly involved as primary drug targets, namely:
- receptors
- enzymes
- carrier molecules (transporters)
- ion channels
- plasma proteins and other tissue proteins

Receptors are protein molecules whose function is to recognise and respond to endogenous chemical signals. Most drugs affect multiple receptors other than their principal ones.

The tendency of a drug to bind to receptors is governed by it's **affinity**, whereas the tendency for it, once bound, to activate the receptor is denoted by its **efficacy**. Agonists activate the receptors, and antagonists combine to the same sites without causing activation, and block the effects of agonists on that receptor. Agonists and antagonists both have high affinity, the former has high efficacy while the latter low. Partial agonists have intermediate levels of efficacy so even with 100% receptor occupation the tissue response is sub-maximal, while full agonists can elicit a maximal tissue response. Receptors can accommodate only one molecule at a time, so a competitive antagonist can reduce the effects of an agonist.

If a ligand reduces the level of constitutive activation; such drugs are known as inverse agonists. Neutral antagonists, by binding to the agonist binding site, will antagonise both agonists and inverse agonists. It turns out that most of the receptor antagonists in clinical use are actually inverse agonists when tested in systems showing constitutive receptor activation. However, most receptors show a preference for the inactive state, and for these there is no practical difference between a competitive antagonist and an inverse agonist.

In addition to the agonist binding site (now referred to as the orthosteric binding site), to which competitive antagonists also bind, receptor proteins possess many other (allosteric) binding sites through which drugs can influence receptor function in various ways, by increasing or decreasing the affinity of agonists for the agonist binding site, by modifying efficacy or by producing a response themselves. Depending on the direction of the effect, the ligands may be allosteric antagonists or allosteric facilitators of the agonist effect.

Other forms of drug antagonism:
- chemical antagonism
  - uncommon situation where the 2 substances combine in a solution thus the effect of the drug is lost
- pharmacokinetic antagonism
  - the 'antagonist' effectively reduces the concentration of of the active drug at its site of action e.g. by increasing metabolic degradation or reduce rate of absorption from the gastrointestinal tract
- block of receptor–response linkage
  - the antagonist blocks at some point downstream from the agonist binding site on the receptor, and interrupts the chain of events that leads to the production of a response by the agonist
- physiological antagonism
  - the interaction of two drugs whose opposing actions in the body tend to cancel each other

### Desensitisation and tolerance
Often, the effect of a drug gradually diminishes when it is given continuously or repeatedly. Desensitisation and tachyphylaxis are synonymous terms used to describe this phenomenon, which often develops in the course of a few minutes. The term tolerance is conventionally used to describe a more gradual decrease in responsiveness to a drug, taking hours, days or weeks to develop, but the distinction is not a sharp one.

- change in receptors
  - The desensitised state is caused by a conformational change in the receptor, resulting in tight binding of the agonist molecule without the opening of the ionic channel. Phosphorylation of intracellular regions of the receptor protein is a second, slower mechanism by which ion channels become desensitised.
- translocation of receptors
  - Prolonged exposure to agonists often results in a gradual decrease in the number of receptors expressed on the cell surface, as a result of internalisation of the receptors. This is a slower process than the uncoupling described above. 
- exhaustion of mediators
  - In some cases, desensitisation is associated with depletion of an essential intermediate substance. Drugs such as amphetamine, which acts by releasing amines from nerve terminals show marked tachyphylaxis because the amine stores become depleted.
- increased metabolic degradation of the drug
  -  Repeated administration of the same dose produces a progressively lower plasma concentration, as a result of increased metabolic degradation.
- physiological adaptation
  - Diminution of a drug’s effect may occur because it is nullified by a homeostatic response. For example, the blood pressure-lowering effect of thiazide diuretics is limited because of a gradual activation of the renin–angiotensin system.
