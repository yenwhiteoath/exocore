# Liumin

"Echospace Liumin" by Deepchord is a genius ambient dub-techno album that evokes a certain vibe that I've been trying to put into words. I achieved the intuition about this while on MDMA but outside the usual rave environment, taking a night walk downtown left on my own with my ultra-positive thoughts. The drug invoked a totemic mood in me, making me feel like a predatory animal inside a jungle of concrete, hunting down sensory experiences, being impressed by decorated bars with their colourful lights, tracking musical sounds coming from nearby clubs, wandering.

>This is what the future sounds like to me. Ethereal, dense, somehow lush while sounding so clean and synthetic

The interplay of otherworldiness and urban life, weaving mystery into the material contemporary.

We usually associate enchantment and the mysterious with the calm sanctity of rural areas, the serene forests, the unknown mountains, melancholic/romantic solitude. Part of the intuition is that this conception is obsolete, and that the real re-enchanment of our age is happening at crowded cities. The environment of a magical realism updated for the 21st century is the contemporary metropolis. Every neon-lit backstreet has its own tribes of people and its own occult history, unwritten and lost in time except when recounted by its participants to their friends during a lack of interesting things to say. I try to think of all the fights and arguments, the business deals, the friendships and loves cultivated, everything else that has taken place here.

"Enter the Void" slightly relates here when it offers us top-down 3rd person views of Tokyo, each city block containing spaces that have been vehicles of sensations to be experienced by humans every night. I see bright blue shining from the windows on 7th floor, I wonder what kind of people have gathered in that party. Across the street, headquarters of an important local company, housing in its desks, hard disk drives and shelves a repository of industry secrets, the competitive corporate environment the C-suite has cultivated molds a true modern mannerbund among its salarymen. Next to it a low-profile chinese restaurant which I've never seen servicing customers, dining probably comes secondary to laundering money, but I see asians often going in only to get lost from my view while descending some stairs at the dark corner of the shop. Will they let me smoke and play cards with them if I join? I stalked some bulgarians to the outskirts of the city and it seems they run a clandestine chemical lab.

Fl√¢nerie always seemed like a psychedelic activity to me, in that the sense of self is being lost in a meditative pure perception of everything happening around the wanderer. It offers a few hours of total disconnection from normal life. Detachment unites with immersion as we blend in the crowd, unpersoned and ready to absorb sensory experience, essentially living frames from the lives of every passer-by.
