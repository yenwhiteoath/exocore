    - Most other studies suggest NMDA antagonism or complex  being the reason why ketamine has antidepressant effects. But other similar NMDA antagonists do not act rapidly, suggesting a different mechanism at play with Ketamine. If this is true then most other studies are wrong.

  - “…So Liston and a team of scientists from the U.S. and Japan gave mice a stress hormone that caused them to act depressed. For example, the animals lost interest in favorite activities like eating sugar and exploring a maze. Then the team used a special laser microscope to study the animals’ brains. The researchers were looking for changes to synapses. “Stress is associated with a loss of synapses in this region of the brain that we think is important in depression,” Liston says. And sure enough, the stressed-out mice lost a lot of synapses. Next, the scientists gave the animals a dose of ketamine. And Liston says that’s when they noticed something surprising. “Ketamine was actually restoring many of the exact same synapses in their exact same configuration that existed before the animal was exposed to chronic stress,” he says. In other words, the drug seemed to be repairing brain circuits that had been damaged by stress.”

  - There is a consensus from most pre-clinical research that AMPAR activity is required for the antidepressant actions of ketamine. Increased probability of glutamate release, either by interneuron-mediated disinhibition or direct action of (2R,6R)-HNK on pyramidal neurons may result in activation of AMPARs, and a subsequent activation of downstream neuroplasticity-related signaling pathways, including those regulated by BDNF and mTORC1, to promote protein synthesis and synaptic plasticity that are involved in ketamine’s behavioral antidepressant actions.

  - Apart from BDNF and mTOR, ketamine administration is also related to an increase in hippocampal Synapsin levels. Since these are markers of neurogenesis and synaptogenesis and that ketamine induces synaptogenesis and spine formation in the prefrontal cortex, ketamine might execute its antidepressive functions through neurotrophic mechanisms.

  - In participants with treatment-resistant depression, GBCr in the altered clusters significantly increased 24h post-ketamine, but not post-midazolam, the active control. As with the prior study, these findings underscored ketamine’s ability to normalize depression-related prefrontal dysconnectivity.

  - Combinations of ketamine and atropine are neuroprotective and reduce neuroinflammation after toxic status epilepticus in mice. In a systematic review of clinical studies, the authors concluded that intra-operative ketamine exerts anti-inflammatory effects.

  - Viral‐mediated hippocampal knockdown of VEGF produced depressive‐like behaviors and decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis in rats, which partially recovered after injection of ketamine. This study suggests that ketamine‐induced VEGF expression might partially contribute to neurogenesis in the hippocampus and the antidepressant‐like effects of ketamine.
