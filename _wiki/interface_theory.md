# Interface theory of truth

People who can't defend
themselves physically (women and
low T men) parse information
through a consensus filter as a
safety mechanism. They literally do
not ask "is this true", they ask "will others be 0K
with me thinking this is true". This makes them very
malleable to brute force manufactured consensus; if
every screen they look at says the same thing they
will adopt that position because their brain
interprets it as everyone in the tribe believing it.
Only high T alpha males and aneurotypical people
(hey autists!) are actually free to parse new
information with an objective "is this true?" filter.
This is why a Republic of high status males is best
for decision making. Democratic, but a democracy
only for those who are free to think.
